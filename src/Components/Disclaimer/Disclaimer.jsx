            <p>The services provided on this portfolio, including web development, WordPress development, and code audit services, are offered based on my expertise and experience in these areas. I strive to deliver high-quality work and tailor solutions to meet each client's needs. However, I make no guarantees regarding specific outcomes, timelines, or compatibility with future technologies or updates beyond our agreed-upon scope of work.</p>
            <p>While I ensure thorough testing and quality checks, I am not liable for any potential issues, losses, or damages that may arise from the use of websites, plugins, or code modifications after the completion of the project. The client is responsible for maintaining the security, functionality, and updates of their website, especially if they choose to make further changes or install additional plugins.</p>
            <p>Code audits are provided to help identify potential improvements or vulnerabilities, but they do not guarantee complete protection against all security threats. I recommend clients implement regular security measures and updates beyond the audit.</p>
            <p>For any questions or further clarification on the terms of my services, please feel free to reach out through the contact information provided on this portfolio.</p>
